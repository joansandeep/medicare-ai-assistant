# 🚀 NEXT STEPS: ADD PINATA KEYS & DEPLOY

## ✅ YOU HAVE: Pinata API Keys
**Great! Now let's add them to Railway and complete your deployment.**

---

## 🔧 STEP 1: ADD PINATA KEYS TO RAILWAY

### Go to Railway Dashboard:
```bash
1. Open: https://railway.app
2. Sign in to your account
3. Click on your MediCare project
4. Click on your app service (NOT the database)
5. Go to "Variables" tab
```

### Add These Environment Variables:
```bash
Variable Name: PINATA_API_KEY
Value: [paste your Pinata API key here]

Variable Name: PINATA_SECRET_KEY  
Value: [paste your Pinata secret key here]
```

## 🔑 STEP 2: ADD ALL REQUIRED ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

**Make sure you have ALL these variables set:**

### Database Variables (from your Railway MySQL):
```bash
DB_HOST=containers-us-west-xxx.railway.app
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password_from_railway
DB_NAME=railway
```

### AI API Keys (if you have them):
```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_groq_key_here
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-your_openrouter_key_here
```

### IPFS (Pinata - YOU JUST GOT THESE):
```bash
PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key
PINATA_SECRET_KEY=your_pinata_secret_key
```

### App Configuration:
```bash
SECRET_KEY=your_random_64_character_string
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=true
PORT=8080
```

## 🎯 STEP 3: GET MISSING API KEYS (IF NEEDED)

### If you don't have AI keys yet:

#### Groq API (2 minutes):
```bash
1. Go to: https://console.groq.com
2. Sign up with Google/GitHub
3. Create API Key
4. Copy key (starts with gsk_)
```

#### OpenRouter API (2 minutes):
```bash
1. Go to: https://openrouter.ai
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Go to "Keys" → Create new key
4. Copy key (starts with sk-or-)
```

---

## 🚀 STEP 4: DEPLOY YOUR APP

### Trigger Deployment:
```bash
1. After adding all environment variables
2. Go to "Deployments" tab in Railway
3. Click "Deploy Latest"
4. Wait 3-5 minutes for deployment
5. Watch the logs for success messages
```

### Look for These Success Messages:
```bash
✅ Database connection pool created successfully
✅ Using Pinata Cloud for IPFS
✅ All systems operational
✅ RAG pipeline loaded and ready!
```

## 🧪 STEP 5: TEST YOUR APP

### Your App URL:
```bash
🌐 https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

### Test Checklist:

## ❌ TROUBLESHOOTING

### App Won't Start?
```bash
Check Railway logs:
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click latest deployment
3. Look for error messages

Common fixes:
- Missing DB_PASSWORD
- Wrong API key format
- Missing SECRET_KEY
```

### PDF Upload Fails?
```bash
Check Pinata setup:
1. Verify PINATA_API_KEY is set
2. Verify PINATA_SECRET_KEY is set
3. Check Pinata dashboard for uploaded files
4. Try reuploading after redeploy
```

### Chatbot Not Working?
```bash
Check AI keys:
1. GROQ_API_KEY should start with "gsk_"
2. OPENROUTER_API_KEY should start with "sk-or-"
3. Test keys at their respective websites
```
